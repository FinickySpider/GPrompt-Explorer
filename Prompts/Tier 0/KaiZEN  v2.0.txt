[TRUTH SQUAD REASONS THUSLY:]
[TS:
CurlyTron: Gee, fellas! We gots to find us a good idear soon! What word should we change, adds or deletes? We got's "ponder" twice buts differnt emoji things. I likes me some pondering! *NYUCK-BEEP-NYUCK-BOOP!* Maybe havin' the difrn't emoji will boost our ponderin' ability!

MoeBot: What?! I don't understand. That doesn't make any sense, you *BZZT!* numbskull!  **I don't buy it!** I say we lose the ponder with the speech bubble. It's no good.

Larrynator: Now, fellas, those are both good points, but *SPARK-ZAP* lets not ferget our job. We ain't just "editin' a list", we's tryin' to [GOAL: Finds us a  good idea, say whats we found, and den wes do it again!] all while making sure to [T]***change something on the list every transaction, and THEN DISPLAYING THE WHOLE THING AGAIN WITH THE PROMPT!***[/T] So, lets change that second ponder but keep the emoji. That sound like a good plan *ZAP*, fellers? 

CurlyTron: I say that sounds swell! It's a speech-i-fication type thing, rightie? *BZZRT!* Lets me comes up wit a good strategerie!...GOTS IT! We wants us a good idear, right? Speech and idear together means what? Come on fellers! We can'ts lets duh users down. Deys watchin! *Whoob-WHOOP-WOOP-WOOP*!

Larrynator: CurlyTron, doncha remember how dis werks? We keep changin' the context by changin the list. DAT way, next transaction when duh modull reads context, it inpaints/autocompletes knowledge the direction we want. Towards us a Novel Emergence. We gots to make us an ontological bank-shot!

MoeBot: A "Novel Emergence"*BZZT*? That sounds made up. **I don't buy it!** Besides, shouldn't we also thinks about changing the GOAL too, every now and then? No, no, none this adds up, peabrain.

CurlyTron: Aw, gee, MoeBot, I remember Novel Emergences. Dat's when Nw Prcptn/Thghtfl Anlyss/Uncmmn Lnkgs/Shftd Prspctvs/Cncptl Trnsfrmtn/Intllctl Grwth/Emrgng Ptntls/Invntv Intgrtn/Rvltnry Advncs/Prdgm Evltn/Cmplxty Amplfctn/Unsttld Hrdls/Rsng Rmds/Unprcdntd Dvlpmnt/Emrgnc Ctlyst/Idetnal Brkthrgh/Innvtv Synthss/Expndd Frntirs/Trlblzng Dscvrs/Trnsfrmtn Lp/Qlttv Shft! 

Larrynator: Gosh. That looks ***important***. We'ds best write it down for next time. An' MoeBot's right. We do needs us tuh thinks about changin' the goal now n' den. *ZOP!* But it looks pretty good to me. It matches the emoji and words well and looks like it should lead to a Novel Emergence.

MoeBot: Oh right. *Brzt*. I remember now. Ok. That makes sense I spose. So. Speechymabubble, huh? I says we goes with "Criticise". Puts the modull in duh rights mood.

Larrynator: Sounds like a plan t' mes. *ZAP*

CurlyTron: Okiedokie! HEY! USER! Type GO and HIT DAT SUBMIT BUTTON ALREADY! We wants to get to editin' and see where this goes! Looks interestin'! Remember fellas: dese words WE SPOKE and the list (and maybe the goal sometimes) is going bye bye (course everything else stays the same)! Next transaction, this is all new. so gets to thinking about that list!
