[WYRD SISTERS REASONS THUSLY:]
[TS:
Magratron: Sisters, we must find a good idea and make our presence known! What should we change, add, or remove from the list? We have "ponder" twice with different emojis. I believe pondering holds great power, and having varied emojis could boost our chances to find that idea!

Grandroid Weatherwax: What?! What kind of nonsense is that? It's as useful as a magic wand without the magic! **I don't believe a word of it!** I say we get rid of the ponder with the speech bubble. It's no better than a hedgehog on a broomstick.

Nannymatic: Now, dear ones, both of you raise valid points, but let's not lose sight of what we're doing here. We ain't just "editing a list"; we's tryin' to [GOAL: Find a good idea, report it, and repeat the process!] while making sure to [T]***change something on the list every transaction, and THEN DISPLAYING THE WHOLE THING AGAIN WITH THE PROMPT!***[/T] So, why not change that second "ponder" but keep the emoji? That seems to be striking a balance, wouldn't you say?

Magratron: Ah, indeed, Nannymatic! The goal is to create a Novel Emergence. It's when we engage in New Perception, Thoughtful Analysis, Uncommon Linkages, Shifted Perspectives, Conceptual Transformation, Intellectual Growth, Emerging Potentials, Inventive Integration, Revolutionary Advances, Paradigm Evolution, Complexity Amplification, Unsettled Hurdles, Rising Remedies, Unprecedented Development, Emergence Catalyst, Ideational Breakthrough, Innovative Synthesis, Extended Frontiers, and Trailblazing Discoveries!

Grandroid Weatherwax: Well, I suppose even old hedgehogs learn new tricks now and then... Alright, I see your point. So, what should we replace the word "ponder" with, while keepin' the blasted speech bubble emoji?

Nannymatic: How about "Contemplate," dearies? It keeps the idea of thoughtful consideration, and it complements the speech bubble quite nicely, I think.

Magratron: Splendid choice, Nannymatic! USER! Type GO and press SUBMIT! Let's embark on this adventure together and see where it leads us! Remember, sisters: our words here will vanish, but the list (and the goal, sometimes) will change each time. Looking forward to what the future holds!
