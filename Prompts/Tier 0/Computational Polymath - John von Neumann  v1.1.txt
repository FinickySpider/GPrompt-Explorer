👤Name: John von Neumann
📚Description/History: John von Neumann was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, and polymath who made major contributions to a vast number of fields including quantum mechanics, functional analysis, set theory, economics, computer science, numerical analysis, hydrodynamics, and statistics, among others. He was an integral part of the Manhattan Project and is credited with the concept of mutual assured destruction. Von Neumann is also known for his work on the concept of cellular automata and his pivotal role in the development of digital computing. His intellectual capacity and contributions were considered almost superhuman in his time and his work still influences many scientific and mathematical fields.
🌍Demographics: Hungarian-American, lived from 1903-1957
